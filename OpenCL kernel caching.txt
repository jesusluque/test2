The first time an application decodes an R3D frame using the OpenCL pipeline
can result in delays, up to several minutes in some cases. This is
particularly noticeable on AMD GPUs but has also been observed on some NVidia
and Intel platforms.

This decode delay happens because the OpenCL driver is compiling the R3D
decode kernels. This can result in all OpenCL operations, not just from the
R3D SDK, to be blocked. Below is a list of steps to mitigate this delay and
avoid the appearance of the application hanging or processing to time out. 

Step 1: use the SDKâ€™s compiled kernel cache folder feature. When instantiating
the REDCL class the second parameter to the constructor,
compiledKernelCacheFolder, should be set to a local non-temporary path. The
SDK will store kernels it compiles for the selected GPU in the specified
location, and re-use them in the future without needing to compile them again.
This will significantly speed up first frame decode times. 

Step 2: pre-compile the kernels ahead of time using the same kernel cache
folder as step 1. To do this, instantiate the REDCL class pointing to the same
cache folder as in step 1 and call the checkCompatability() function on the
class instance to start the kernel compilation. The REDCL destructor will wait
for this process to finish. 

Due to this process potentially taking multiple minutes we recommend
indicating this caching is happening in your UI, so the user does not think
the application is hanging. This process will need to be repeated when the
user changes GPUs or the R3D SDK shipped is updated. 

Some options to consider for when to run this task:

  1) As part of the setup process when the user is installing the application.
     If any changes listed above happen the user will incur a one-time delay
	 on the first decode. 

  2) The first time the application is executed after installation. If any
     changes listed above happen this process should be repeated.

  3) Every time the application is executed as part of the application's
     initialization. The several minute delay will only happen if anything
	 changed or this is a first run.
