/* Sample to store all audio in a .au file. Unlike the previous
   sample this one does not use the audio block interface but
   the sample interface. This allows random seeking in the
   audio track and retrieving a certain number of samples. The
   sample uses a 1MB buffer to store the samples in. 
   
   The output of this sample is exactly the same as the previous
   sample code that iterates through the audio blocks. */
